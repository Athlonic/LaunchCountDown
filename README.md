[0.21.1] Athlonic Electronics / LCD - Launch CountDown (Audio&Onscreen)
v1.2 (August 14/2013)


Bored of yelling the launch countdown yourself ?
Do you find the launch sequence a little ... lifeless ?

So here comes an enhancement for your launch clamps : an authentical launch countdown brought to you by Athlonic Electronics.

_________________________________________________________
Installation :

- You just have to install the "LaunchCountDown" folder as usual under your KSP "GameData" folder.

It will upgrade your KSP stock TT18-A Launch Stability Enhancer (aka launch clamp) with a countdown feature.
No additional parts needed thanks to the excellent "ModuleManager" plugin (included) from Ialdabaoth.

How it works ?


* When building your rockets, you can assign actions (Start Countdown and Abort Launch) shortcut key/button for launch clamps in the action group editor tab.
or/and
* When on the launch pad, just Push dah "Go Flight !" Button.



Be aware that it will auto-activate the launch stage once the countdown reach "Ignition" so plan your stage accordingly :


-> First stage : Engines AND launch clamps,
-> and do NOT wait ignition to put some generous throttle...

Mechjeb's autopilot users :
1. Setup your ascension profile,
2. Engage MJ autopilot,
3. Start the countdown,
4. Sit back and relax ^^

Known issues :
- you may spend too much time on the launch pad now ^^
- let me know if you find some more...
